# RAIN-SENSE

**Story**

In the mornings I sometimes walk to school or work and sometimes the weather can suddenly turn bad, which has 2 different problems for me;

- Getting wet and sick because of the rain, which I don't want because I don't like a runny nose.
- I have my computer or phone in my bag and it can get wet and break, which is a problem.


If it's going to rain in the next 12 hours, it sends you a message at a time you specify, but for this you need to install <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" style="text-decoration:none; color:salmon;">python anywhere</a>.

Not only does this program save me from getting wet, but it also helps me organize my life.

Personally, I like projects like this that make my life easier, simple but impressive, it makes me feel good.
